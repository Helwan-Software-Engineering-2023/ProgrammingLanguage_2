[!] to Start working with the files you need to go to /Assets/FileHandler.java

inside it there is a variable called (homePath) that you need to update its path with your own path to the project 

example :  private final String homePath = "D:\\college\\Second Year\\First__Term\\Programming_Language_2\\Project\\SourceCode\\CollegeExamManagementSystem\\src\\Assets\\";
replaceTo :                                  "your Path To The Projrct \\ CollegeExamManagementSystem\\src\\Assets\\ "
                                                                           ^__--> Project Name
